                                    always enjoyable. It
                                    makes us want to do more, lift more, and feel even more powerful. The downside is
                                    that eventually, the gains may stall and what previously worked may not be as
                                    effective.

                                    When these “plateaus” arrive, stop doing what the rookies do and try something
                                    different.

                                    Before we proceed, a word of advice. This program is likely a change from what
                                    you’re used to as it focuses primarily on lifting heavy.

                                    If you’re concerned about shape and getting shredded, this is not the program for
                                    you. If you want to move some serious weight in eight weeks that you don’t think you
                                    can move today, keep reading.</p>

                                    to
                                    slack on the diet. The
                                    food you eat matters even more now because you are trying to make your body do
                                    something
                                    it
                                    can’t do now. So, 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day, 1.5-2 grams of
                                    carbs
                                    per pound, and .5 grams of fats are what I would suggest. You can slightly alter
                                    those
                                    numbers based on your experience, but it should be close to those numbers. Also, 1
                                    gallon of
                                    water per day.

                                    As for recovery, sleep is the biggest one so get a lot of it. You could also do
                                    massages,
                                    cold plunges, stretching, and chiropractor work. They aren’t all necessary but will
                                    help
                                    and
                                    will positively influence your success in this program. </p>
